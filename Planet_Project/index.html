                    <p>Mercury, the innermost planet of the solar system and the eighth in size and mass. Its closeness to the Sun and its smallness make it the most elusive of the planets visible to the unaided eye. Because its rising or setting is always within about two hours of the Sun’s, it is never observable when the sky is fully dark. Mercury is designated by the symbol ☿. <br>
                        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, at a distance of 57.91 million kilometers / 35.98 miles or 0.4 AU away. It takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.

                    <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, is comparable in size and composition to Earth, though it is slightly smaller and has a thick, toxic atmosphere. Venus is visible to the naked eye and often called Earth’s "sister planet" due to their similarities in size and mass. Its brightness makes it the third-brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. Venus is represented by the symbol ♀.
                        Venus is approximately 108.2 million kilometers / 67.24 million miles or 0.72 AU from the Sun, taking about 6 minutes for sunlight to reach it.

                    <p>Earth, the third planet from the Sun, is the only known planet to support life, thanks to its optimal atmosphere and water abundance. Earth's moderate temperatures and magnetic field protect life from solar radiation, and it has a single natural satellite, the Moon. Earth’s symbol is ♁.
                        The average distance from Earth to the Sun is 149.6 million kilometers / 92.96 million miles or 1 AU, and sunlight takes roughly 8.3 minutes to reach Earth.

                    <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun and second smallest in the solar system, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its iron oxide surface. Known for its towering volcanoes and canyon systems, Mars has attracted attention as a potential site for future human exploration. Mars is represented by the symbol ♂.
                        Mars orbits the Sun at an average distance of 227.9 million kilometers / 141.6 million miles or 1.52 AU, with sunlight taking about 12.7 minutes to reach it.
